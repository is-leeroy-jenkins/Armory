    "## 🧭 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microsoft Access is not just a spreadsheet replacement — it’s a **relational database system** that uses a version of SQL known as **Jet/ACE SQL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the SQL syntax in Access looks similar to SQL Server or MySQL, it has unique behavior, functions, and data-type handling rules because it’s interpreted by the **Microsoft Access Database Engine (ACE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access stores all database tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules in the Access Jet database as a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For query development, Access offers a `Query Designer`, a graphical user interface that allows users to build queries without knowledge of structured query language. In the Query Designer, users can \"show\" the datasources of the query (which can be tables or queries) and select the fields they want returned by clicking and dragging them into the grid. One can set up joins by clicking and dragging fields in tables to fields in other tables. Access allows users to view and manipulate the SQL code if desired. Any Access table, including linked tables from different data sources, can be used in a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access also supports the creation of \"pass-through queries\". These snippets of SQL code can address external data sources through the use of ODBC connections on the local machine. This enables users to interact with data stored outside the Access program without using linked tables or Jet. Users construct the pass-through queries using the SQL syntax supported by the external data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When developing reports (in \"Design View\") additions or changes to controls cause any linked queries to execute in the background and the designer is forced to wait for records to be returned before being able to make another change. This feature cannot be turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-programmers can use the macro feature to automate simple tasks through a series of drop-down selections. Macros allow users to easily chain commands together such as running queries, importing or exporting data, opening and closing forms, previewing and printing reports, etc. Macros support basic logic (IF-conditions) and the ability to call other macros. Macros can also contain sub-macros which are similar to subroutines. In Access 2007, enhanced macros included error-handling and support for temporary variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Access 2007 also introduced embedded macros that are essentially properties of an object's event. This eliminated the need to store macros as individual objects. However, macros were limited in their functionality by a lack of programming loops and advanced coding logic until Access 2013. \n",
    "\n",
    "- With significant further enhancements introduced in Access 2013, the capabilities of macros became fully comparable to VBA. They made feature rich web-based application deployments practical, via a greatly enhanced Microsoft SharePoint interface and tools, as well as on traditional Windows desktops\n",

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- Microsoft Access applications can adopt a split-database architecture. The single database can be divided into a separate \"back-end\" file that contains the data tables (shared on a file server) and a \"front-end\" (containing the application's objects such as queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"front-end\" Access application is distributed to each user's desktop and linked to the shared database. Using this approach, each user has a copy of Microsoft Access (or the runtime version) installed on their machine along with their application database. This reduces network traffic since the application is not retrieved for each use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"front-end\" database can still contain local tables for storing a user's settings or temporary data. This split-database design also allows development of the application independent of the data. One disadvantage is that users may make various changes to their own local copy of the application and this makes it hard to manage version control. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When a new version is ready, the front-end database is replaced without impacting the data database. Microsoft Access has two built-in utilities, Database Splitter and Linked Table Manager, to facilitate this architecture."
